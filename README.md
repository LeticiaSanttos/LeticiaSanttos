### Hi! My name is Letícia Santos 👋

<p>
📚 I graduated in Computer Technician at IFSP and currently I'm pursuing a technologist degree in Systems Analysis and Development.
</br>
👩🏻‍💻 I have previously worked as an intern programmer in the Geoprocessing department at SEPLAN of the City Hall of Praia Grande. I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in addition to utilizing frameworks such as Bootstrap, Vue.js, and Vuetify.
</br>
💻 I also gained some knowledge in the Python programming language, which was used in the development of my Final Course Project.
</br>
🎯My goal is to specialize and work as a FrontEnd developer.
</br>
